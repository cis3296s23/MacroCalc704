The original open-sourced api used for the basis of this project can be found here: https://github.com/yihanwu/Nutrient_Calculator.
The main differences between the basis and the app we have modified is that MacroCalc allows for users to signin, which allows users to share recipes, download recipes, save recipes, upload recipes, and more separation of the app into different pages for increased accessibility and ease of use.
