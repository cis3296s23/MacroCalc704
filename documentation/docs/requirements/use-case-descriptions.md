# Who Uses MacroCalc?

- Jane (28) is a marketing manager at a small company. She has a Bachelor's degree in
marketing and is passionate about health and fitness. She has a busy work schedule that
leaves her with limited time to prepare meals, so she is always looking for ways to
improve her nutrition. She is aware of her macro and micronutrient intake and currently
tracks her meals on a spreadsheet. Jane is looking for a tool that can help her quickly
calculate the nutrient breakdown of her meals, make modifications, and compare different
meals. She wants a user friendly interface application that is easily accessible and can
work offline.

- Dee (34) is a Doctor who has had multiple patients ask for help with health and weight. Dee has
many patients and cannot give specific advice for everyone, let alone be their fitness coach. Many
patients also complain that a personal fitness instructor is too much time and money. She decides
to try and find an app that allows patients to help track their own food intake. This was so Dee
would have a free app that she could recommend to her patients. She herself sometimes uses the
app but has encouraged many to start tracking their journey through the app with what they eat.

- Sarah (35) is a working mother who wants to improve her health and feel more confident in her
body. She has a busy schedule and limited time for meal prep, which makes it hard for her to
maintain a healthy diet. Sarah has tried various diets in the past, but has struggled to stick to them
long-term. She is looking for a tool that can help her track her calorie and nutrient intake, provide
healthy meal options, and offer personalized recommendations. The app should be easy to use
and accessible so that she can use it while on the go. Sarah wants to see quick feedback on her
daily progress so that she can stay motivated and reach her goals.

- Tannor (26) is an aspiring bodybuilder who hopes to one day compete in bodybuilding
competitions. To reach this goal he knows it is imperative to optimize his diet as well as his
training regimen. He is highly motivated, detail oriented, and enjoys tracking his progress in the
gym. Despite this Tannor finds it challenging to stay consistent with tracking his food intake. He
has tried using journals and other tracking apps but found them to be tedious or difficult to use.
For these reasons Tannor is looking for a tracking app that is simple to use but still provides him
with the detailed macronutrient breakdown of his meals.
