# Development Environment
Languages used are R, javascript, and python. 

**R:** R was used as the "meat" of the application. Working within RStudio, this is where the application and interaction with it lies. The ui, graphs, buttons, side bars, etc... are all such things that were implemented using R. Testing was done within R. R was crucial to the development of the app and a large portion of the work written was done within R.

**Python:** In the end python was used to handle servers and databases. This allows the app to store users' information on signin so data can be associated with their acccount. Without this users would only be able to cache data on their system locally, so having the ability to continue from another device due to the signin option is a massive convience.

**Javascript:** This was used to allow users to be able to signin. Here the data is actually stored and sorted properly, along with having an authentication. Javascript and python work closely together to allow for this feature to function. While a little percent of the coding was done within javascript and python, they are essential for a crucial feature of the app. This feature could not have been done with only R.
